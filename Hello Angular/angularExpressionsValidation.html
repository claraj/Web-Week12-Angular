  <!--Notice the ng-show directive. This means only show this element if the expression is true.
   So, this h2 is only show if "(price != undefined) && (quantity != undefined)" is true.
   In other words, while the price or the quantity is undefined - not filled in -
   this element is not shown (hidden).  There's also a ng-hide directive which does the opposite,
   sometimes the logic is easier to write. -->
  <h2 ng-show=" (price != undefined) && (quantity != undefined) ">
    The total price is {{ price * quantity }}

  <!-- Using ng-hide - this commented out code behaves the same as the previous H2. -->
  <!--

  <h2 ng-hide=" (price == undefined) || (quantity == undefined) ">
    The total price is {{ price * quantity }}
